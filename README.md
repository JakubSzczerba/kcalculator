## General info
My project of application for helthy lifestyle and calorie counting. Web aplication for everyone who wants to take care of health.

## Technologies
* PHP - version 7.3.2
* Symfony - version 5.2.6
* MySQL/Doctrine 

## Setup
I using for this project Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). To install you need a composer. After creating a symfony skeleton u need to instal security bundle for user's login and 
register support. Second thing is Doctrine. In code example u can see my configuration for using phpmyadmin. Just delete tag and write correct values.
Products database -> ( https://github.com/MK-PL/Tabele-kaloryczne-i-zawartosci-bialka-tluszczu-weglowodanow-w-produktach-spozywczych ). After downloand xml neet to change file
